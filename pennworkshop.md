# My Reflection after Attending a Workshop at Penn

I attended the Education Commons Vinyl Decals workshop on December 5th. It was led by Tex Kang in the 1st floor of Van Pelt (Weigle Information Commons).

It was mostly a drop-in workshop where we got to print our own vinyl decorations. I got to observe and learn about the software used to print (cut) in the vinyl. It was a software that came with the cutting/printing machine that resembled Adobe Illustrator, but in a different color. The drawings or shapes were taken from the internet, passed on to this software, and then a piece of colored vinyl was introduced in the machine. From there, the machine would print/cut out the vinyl. The machine was incredibly precise, with it cutting just the surface of the vinyl strip to make the sticker but not cut out the entire piece. I came up with two different designs since there was no line. First, I printed out an abstraction of my country’s flag (no white background), and then my initials to put in my travel bags. I’ll attach pictures of the machine, the process, the end result, and myself in the workshop.

As far as my take-aways from this workshop, I asked Tex what he would like people to remember as a salient message. He mentioned how we already had the technology to create these products before: we can take scissors and cut out complex designs out of vinyl. However, that would probably take hours of careful work and effort. Having that vinyl cutting machine frees users up to be able to work on something else while it cuts, or even engage others in conversation. Plus, it does the same precise work in very little time. To prove his point, I was able to hold conversation with Tex even as he was working the cutting machine throughout the workshop. His ideas made me reflect on the effects that machine evolution have had on people’s leisure. It made me think about how much time we are able to use for other matters because someone invented a machine that frees up our time.

At first, I found it hard to relate the content of the workshop to what we have done in this class. I looked through our assigned readings to see if anything sparked a connection, and I think I found one in Jentery Sayers’ I Don’t Know All the Circuitry. In it, Sayers states that “Although we may understand how something works, we may not apprehend how or under what conditions it was made.” (Page 2) I think this relates back to the usage of the vinyl cutting machine, as I both “understand how it works” and also do not actually understand how it works. If I was asked to take the machine apart and explain how its pieces interact, I would not be able to do so. Meanwhile, I would probably be able to operate the machine. As for the latter half of the statement, I do not understand how or under what conditions that machine was made. In not understanding this, I risk not understanding the machine at all. As the reading goes on to argue, technology does not exist in a vacuum, away from the circumstances and conditions of its creation.

Furthermore, I think the workshop was a continuation of our collaboration with the Education Commons and their technology. It was cool to see another of their machines in action. This, and the connection to the reading, are the ways I connected it to our class content, but I’m sure other connections exist.
