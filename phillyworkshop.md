# My reflection on a attending a Workshop in Philly

I attended the Meshtastic Workshop at Iffy Books on October 23rd.

The workshop taught us how to set up the infrastructure needed for long distance encrypted messaging. We learned how to set up our own nodes of radios used for messaging across relatively long distances (LORA Radios). These nodes, when set up, can be used with the Meshtastic application to message others without using cellular service. Attached is a picture of the demo message that was sent at the end of the workshop that showcased the messaging app with the LORA (long range) nodes. The Meshtastic “mesh” of nodes in Philly has been slowly growing, with more users setting up nodes and routers in high places around the city, allowing others to use the messaging method.

The workshop zine includes information on how to set up the nodes and Meshtastic app for computers, iOS, and Android devices. It is very inclusive of the many devices that people may own and rely on to message each other.

As was discussed in the workshop, these nodes and the application are useful for a variety of reasons. They can be used in instances of extreme sports that require distance or remote places, such as surfing, climbing, camping, etc. It might allow people to send messages across long distances where cell service isn’t available. This extends to occasions when a natural disaster disables communication services. Furthermore, many members in the workshop found the radical implications of it most interesting. The ability to send messages without government or private company oversight in the case of a protest or other confidential matters was stressed as a good use of the nodes and the app.

I think the workshop both did and did not intersect with what we have been learning in class. I think it didn’t in the sense that our class has been mostly focusing on the usage of technology for archival, preservation, and research matters. This technology lends itself more to secrecy and private correspondence that cannot be tracked, not for the preservation of history or written records.

The workshop did, however, intersect with the class in what I perceived to be the politics of the usage of these devices. Meshtastic is all about decentering and going against pre-written narratives; it is trying to provide an alternative to the path everyone uses and that might be pushed on us. This is similar to the way the Digital Humanities class has been encouraging us to think about how we need to think outside the box to include narratives that have been neglected or left out. While certain archives or information have been classified a certain way, we must make an effort to re-evaluate how we see things and be more inclusive of marginalized communities. 

Overall, I learned a lot in the workshop. I not only learned about the technology behind radio and long distance messaging, but also about the needs of the Philadelphia community that favors the usage of this technology. It is always great to be interested in how the technology we use works, and to seek out alternatives in case that technology does not feel suitable for us in the future. 

Attached are also two other pictures: one is a selfie with Dominique Chamorro who also attended the workshop, and the other is a selfie outside Iffy Books door.
