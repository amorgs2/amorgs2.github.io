# Looking Forward

Regrettably, I found this class and the corresponding minor very late in my undergraduate career, and I am graduating at the end of this semester. However, I did enjoy this introduction to the Digital Humanities field and would like to learn more about it. I will outline some ways in which I will seek to do so:

1. I’m considering enrolling in a Graduate program for Digital Humanities, or a related field. I’m not sure which ones I will be applying to yet, but Professor Trettien showed me some in King’s College London that look promising. Their Big Data in Culture and Societies MA looks particularly interesting.

2. I’m interested in the work of Giorgia Lupi and will look out for anything made or written by her in the future. I’m particularly interested in the way she crafts complex data visualizations that complicate the usual bars and pie charts we are used to. I’d love to be able to do that in the future in my own projects.
   
3. While I did complete the Computer Science minor here in Penn, I think I need to brush up on my coding skills, especially with Python. I’ll be looking at some coding videos on Youtube to improve on certain languages I want to master.
